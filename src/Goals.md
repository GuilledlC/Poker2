### 1.1 Deck and Cards

Cards are made of a Rank and a Suit. The Deck is a French Deck, 
made up of 13 cards, in which the first card is an Ace (A), and 
the last three are the Jack, Queen, and King respectively (J, Q, K).

### 1.2 Pot

The pot is the sum of money the players contribute each round. A 
forced contribution (Ante) may be required to incentivize players 
not to fold each round as they lose money every round.
