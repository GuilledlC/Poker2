What if in Player.bet(int bet) the player doesnt have enough chips??
Should the dealer burn cards?
What is the minimum bet?
Need to enforce player order
If a player disconnects they fold
If the Server closes, what do we do??
    Make a ServerClosedException
        Unexpected vs Expected???

The network.Client can either
1) Start a network.Server
    1.1) Connect to said network.Server (GOTO 2)
2) Connect to a network.Server
    2.1) Register as player
        2.1.1) If is host, can start the game
    2.2) Signal ready
    2.3) Play
    2.4) GOTO 2.2
    2.5) Leave
        2.5.1) If is host, ends the game (work on transferring)
